# Negotiation Agent

This project involved building a negotiation agent in colobortation with two others for my module Intelligent Agents at the University of Southampton. This work recived a grade of 76%. For methods and results please see the link below.

Abstract—Agent 17 combines novel ideas with well-established
methods in the agent-based negotiation field. Here we introduce
an approach in its strategy, which is to hot-swap into specific
algorithms at optimal moments. This strategy aims to maximise
the agent’s utility, whilst also minimising the distance from
the Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we explore techniques for
tuning an agent’s hyperparameters through various optimisation
algorithms
